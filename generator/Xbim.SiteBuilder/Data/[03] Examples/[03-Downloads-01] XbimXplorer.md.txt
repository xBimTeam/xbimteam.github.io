# xBIM Xplorer

![XbimXplorer](/examples/images/XbimXplorer.png)

This application is one one of the demonstrators of the xBIM Toolkit.

It's a .NET Windows application running on WPF that demonstrates how to use some of the APIs of the toolkit.

You can download the code as part of the [xBIM WindowsUI repository](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimWindowsUI) or download a [precompiled installer](http://www.overarching.it/dload/XbimXplorer/Setup.exe).

The precompiled installer uses a [slighly modified version](https://github.com/CBenghi/Squirrel.Windows) of [Squirrel.Windows](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows) to keep the version on your computer up to date when you launch it, so once installed you don't have to worry about new releases.
