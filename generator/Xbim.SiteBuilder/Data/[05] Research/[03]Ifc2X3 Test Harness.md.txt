# Ifc2x3 Test Harness

## Background

A key constraint in the uptake of Building Information Modelling (BIM) is interoperability of geometries. 
In 2012 we have done some work investigating the issues of authoring reusable BIM components that can be delivered across multiple platforms. 
To support this research a simple test model was constructed to include representative and challenging geometries that are encountered in Ifc files. 

Our analysis was eventually [published on IJ3DIM](https://www.igi-global.com/article/constraints-authoring-bim-components-optimal/77815).

## Download

This pages makes the test model [available for download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xBimTeam/XbimWindowsUI/master/XbimXplorer/BIM%20Logo.ifc) if you wish to replicate the study or test your IFC implementation.
Once opened in your viewer of choice the model should look as the following image.

We are now working on a more complete IFC4 Geometry test suite. Get in touch if interested.
